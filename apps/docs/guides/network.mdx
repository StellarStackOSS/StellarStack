# Network Configuration

Configure ports, firewall rules, and network settings for your game servers.

<Info>
  This guide is currently being expanded. Network configuration is available in the web panel server settings.
</Info>

## Port Configuration

Each game server needs one or more ports:

1. Navigate to your server
2. Go to **Settings** → **Network**
3. Configure port mappings:
   - **Game Port**: Main server port (e.g., 25565 for Minecraft)
   - **Query Port**: Server query port (optional)
   - **RCON Port**: Remote console port (optional)

## Port Allocation

Ports are allocated per node:

- Multiple servers can run on different ports
- Port conflicts prevented automatically
- Port ranges can be reserved for specific servers

## Firewall Rules

Ensure ports are open:

- Configure UFW on Linux
- Add firewall rules for game ports
- Open query and RCON ports if needed

Example (Ubuntu):
```bash
sudo ufw allow 25565/tcp
sudo ufw allow 25565/udp
```

## DDoS Protection

Recommended security practices:

- Use UDP/TCP appropriately per game type
- Consider DDoS protection services
- Monitor traffic patterns
- Block suspicious IPs if needed

## Networking Issues

Troubleshoot connectivity:

- Verify ports are open
- Check firewall rules
- Test with network tools
- Monitor server logs
